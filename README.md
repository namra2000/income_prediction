# Income Prediction Model

This project is an implementation of a machine learning model designed to predict individual income levels based on demographic features. The model classifies individuals into two income categories: **above or below 50K per year**.

## Overview
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model capable of predicting income levels using various features such as age, education, marital status, occupation, and others. The project explores multiple classification techniques, evaluates their performance, and selects the best performing model.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of several demographic features. Typical features include:
- `age`
- `workclass`
- `education`
- `marital-status`
- `occupation`
- `relationship`
- `race`
- `sex`
- `capital-gain`
- `capital-loss`
- `hours-per-week`

### Target
- `Income` (binary: >50K or <=50K)

### Preprocessing Steps:
- Handling missing values.
- Encoding categorical variables using label encoding or one-hot encoding.
- Feature scaling for numeric variables.
  
## Requirements
Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following packages installed:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Modeling Approach
The project follows a typical machine learning pipeline:
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing data, encoding categorical features, and normalizing numerical data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing the relationships between features and the target variable.
3. **Model Building:** Multiple models are trained, such as:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Trees
   - Random Forest
   - Gradient Boosting
4. **Model Evaluation:** Models are evaluated based on performance metrics such as:
   - Accuracy
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - F1 Score
   - ROC-AUC Curve

## Results
The best-performing model is selected based on the metrics and evaluation criteria. Fine-tuning may be performed to optimize the selected model.

## Usage
To use the notebook and replicate the results:
1. Clone the repository or download the `Income_Prediction_Model.ipynb`.
2. Run the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
3. Ensure the dataset is loaded correctly and preprocessing steps are followed.
4. Train and evaluate the models.

```bash
jupyter notebook Income_Prediction_Model.ipynb
```
